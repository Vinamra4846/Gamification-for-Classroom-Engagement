                    In this game we will create 3 levels: easy, medium and hard. At the start of the game the shapes are hidden. The player clicks on the tiles to uncover the tile and when two similar tiles are uncovered the score increases. To complete the game the user has to uncover all the pairs of shapes. After completion of the game, the number of moves required to complete the game is also displayed on the screen.

                    Going back to our old school days, some of the pen-paper games were always a top for our leisure time. Hangman was one, other than some chit games, to guess words according to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were hanged (not really, but on paper ðŸ˜‰). That is an old way, now to play Hangman. The new advancement in technologies allows us to play hangman using our own computer also without any other player. How? Letâ€™s find out further.
